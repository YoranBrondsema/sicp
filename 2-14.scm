; We've seen in 2-8 that for addition and subtraction, the width of the
; resulting interval is the sum of the widths in the operands. For
; multiplication, we saw in 2-12 that the width is approximately the sum of the
; tolerances.

; This means that for every operation, the error increases. So avoiding to
; reuse an uncertain number limits the error.
